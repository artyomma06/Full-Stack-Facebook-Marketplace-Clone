# OpenMRKT the Facebook Marketplace clone

## Description

This is a full-stack clone of Facebook Marketplace called OpenMRKT. It is a mobile-first, full-stack web application that allows users to login, post listings, contact sellers on a listing, and perform various filtering queries.

- Designed the user interface using React and Material-UI components
- Used Node.js and Express.js to establish a RESTful API fetching information from a PostgreSQL database
- User login information is encrypted to prevent malicious access
- User authentication is handled through cookies
- All components were fully tested using Jest to maintain 100% code coverage
- Stores user and listing information on a PostgreSQL server running on Docker
